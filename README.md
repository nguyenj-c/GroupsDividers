# Groups Dividers

Created as part of the course [ECUE15] entitled "Development of dynamic Web sites and referencing".

## Description

GÃ©rard MENVUSSA, teacher at the IUT, has the habit, for the TP, to make the students work in group.

The creation of the groups is usually done in a random way, the names of the students are written on pieces of paper deposited in a cap and, an innocent hand draws the members of each group.

This year, we have to find another method. You are therefore in charge, as an individual (although you can help each other), of producing a small application whose objective is to create these working groups.
